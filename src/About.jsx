            <p className='aboutP'>  Hi, I’m Afiq Amjad! I’m currently a senior at Boston University majoring in Computer Science. My interest lies in front-end web development--particularly in creating sleek, responsive, and accessible applications. I am most comfortable with React, CSS, HTML, JavaScript; with experience in using Node.js and Express. </p>

            <p className='aboutP'> Outside of coding, I am passionate about photography. I capture in both 35mm film and digital, using an Olympus OM-2 as well as a Fujifilm XT-20. I like to challenge myself in capturing pictures that evoke nostalgia and serenity, playing mainly with composition and color.

            </p>
